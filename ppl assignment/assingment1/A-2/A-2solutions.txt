1   How have if-blocks  been translated into GIMPLE  statements? Can you
    differentiate between conditional and unconditional gotos?

ANSWER :If-blocks are turned into conditional gotos and further to labels.Conditional gotos have two labels one for if block and other for else block whereas unconditional gotos are self declared.

2   Repeat  the  above compilation,  but  now  asking for  another  dump
    that  of  the pass  "cfg".  View  this  pass  and say  whether  this
    representation makes it easier to  read and understand GIMPLEs. Draw
    the control-flow graph  of the program A-2.c on a  piece of paper by
    looking at the CFG dump.

ANSWER :yes for sure this representation makes it easy to read and understand gimple but the code length is too large.
