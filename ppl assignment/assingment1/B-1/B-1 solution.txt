Questions
---------

1   The body  of AddTwo(x)  seems to  be inlined into  the call  of main rendering the function useless (nobody else is calling it). Then why is the     definition of AddTwo(x) still there all the way till the last pass (B-1.c.*.optimized)?

ANS :It can't be discarded as it can be called from other function.


2   Is there any way to get rid of it?

ANS :Yes,we can add static keyword to prototype to signify that its linkage is internal only.
