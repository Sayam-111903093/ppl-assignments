Questions
---------
1   Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
    the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?

ANSWER : bb3 and bb4 correspond to the while loop.here bb2 avoids executing the iteration as it is having unconditional goto which is assigned in the while           loop whereas in the if-else loop goto seems to be conditional.

2   Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
    able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
    loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
    special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?
 
ANSWER : bb5 is outer loop variable initialization whereas bb6 is inner loop variable initialization.
         bb10 is for checking outer loop conditions and bb8 is used for checking inner loop conditions.
         bb9 is used for incrementing outer variable and bb7 is used for incrementing inner variable and it also represents loop body.
